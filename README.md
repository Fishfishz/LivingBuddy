# LivingBuddy

### Project Idea:
For those living on campus… have you ever went all the way done to the first floor for exercising but found out that all the equipment is in use？Have you ever had a burning question for your RA but did not know how to reach them? Have you ever had an exam in the morning but cannot fall asleep because upstairs was drumming? The living buddy is here for you! It’s an app to tell you the status of the utility equipment/rooms in your dorm, to get you up to date with everything you need to know about your dorm, and to get you connected with RAs and fellow students.

### Project Goals:
LivingBuddy will have the following functionalities:

- Dashboard - designed to announce upcoming student events, alerts, monthly newsletter, and policies. 
- Chat Thread - designed for students to communicate and help to form the living community. The idea comes from slack. 
- Discuss Board - designed for students to post anecdotes, concerns or whatever they want, for example like, I found the light in the garbage room is out of work, or the building is way too cold.
- Calendar Schedule - Indicating whether the public service (washing machine, piano room, game area, etc.) is in use. Students who are using any service need to register the status for it on the website. 

### Layout of the repository:
- reports - This folder contains the weekly reports that are due 22:00 every Wednesday.
- my-app - This folder contains the code for Living Buddy Web App
