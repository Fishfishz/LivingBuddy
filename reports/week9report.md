 - Goals from last week:
   - Work with Yazan to complete at least the prototype of chat thread. This is not a hard deadline, as we still have time until final release, but it is best to have a buffer in our schedule.
   - Contribute to the peer review assignment.
 - What I have worked on this week
   - I have completed the peer review assignment. 
   - I have met up with Yazan to try different ways of implementing the chat thread. We initially tried using an existing framework with the chat almost entirely implemented, but tailoring this to our project has proven difficult. Instead, we decided to manually create the chat thread where the visual components share a consistent theme with the template we have been using. Basic functionality of this has been implemented.
 - Goals:
   - Next week is the deadline for the chat thread, and I would like to clear up some bugs that are left for this functionality.
   - Complete the demo presentation.
