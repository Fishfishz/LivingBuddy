Andy
- Goals from last week: 
  - Make buttons bigger for the landing page, and make it squares that divide the page.
  - Make the rooms and equipments table show up in a new tab.
- What I have done:
  - Reviewed screw the review’s team’s assignment. Talked about what I think they did well and what they might be able to improve on. Overall it was a great project so there wasn’t a lot I can point out. Only made some minor suggestions on the way they organized documentations and code. Did it because I got confused from the two repos they have, one for server and one for rest of the code.
- Goals:
  - Make buttons bigger for the landing page, and make it squares that divide the page.
  - Make the rooms and equipments table show up in a new tab.
  - Make the rooms and equipments table show more information about the subject.


Chris
 - Goals from last week:
   - Work with Yazan to complete at least the prototype of chat thread. This is not a hard deadline, as we still have time until final release, but it is best to have a buffer in our schedule.
   - Contribute to the peer review assignment.
 - What I have worked on this week
   - I have completed the peer review assignment. 
   - I have met up with Yazan to try different ways of implementing the chat thread. We initially tried using an existing framework with the chat almost entirely implemented, but tailoring this to our project has proven difficult. Instead, we decided to manually create the chat thread where the visual components share a consistent theme with the template we have been using. Basic functionality of this has been implemented.
 - Goals:
   - Next week is the deadline for the chat thread, and I would like to clear up some bugs that are left for this functionality.
   - Complete the demo presentation.
