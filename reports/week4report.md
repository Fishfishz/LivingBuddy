Team Report: 
Goal from past week : Next week, we will be experimenting with the frameworks we have chosen to get a feel of what architecture and design will be suitable for this project. It is in our best interest not to start implementing the functionalities too soon, as it is important that we have a blueprint that will satisfy the requirements we have written last week
We spent most of our time revising our requirements and talking about the software architecture design. We also set up the react project and pushed it to Github so that all of us can clone it on our separate machines. Something we learned is features of Git, both from the in class exercises and exploring git on our own.
Goals for the following week: 
Searching for a suitable UI template that can be used as the theme of the app, which would be a task for Chris and Yazan, as their focus is on the dashboard, the most visible component.
Finalize software architecture and design, which would be done in collaboration.
Finalize the ER diagram design for the database(Google firebase). Build the designed schema on the google firebase.

Individual Report:

Frank
 Goals from a week ago: 
Set up the Github and Google firebase project
Set up a React project and push to Github
Work on the database architecture design
Finalize the details for the discussion board functionality and start to implement it with Andy
what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck:
I worked on the github setup for this project. I set up a react project and git ignore. I learned how to set up and link the google firebase into javascripts. I am stuck on the actual deployment into production. Since it's early in the development stage, weâ€™ll first test locally and figure out the CICD in later weeks. 
Goals for the following week: 
Work on the login page.
Search for a consistent UI template for the calendar scheduler. 
Research for libraries and start to implement the calendar scheduler
Finish the database design and build the schema in google firebase.

Yazan
 Goals from a week ago: 
Next week, I will be teaming up with Chris to work on the Design for the Dashboard of our app and also finalize the features like ChatBox requirements.

what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck:
I spent most of the time brushing pup our requirements based on the feedback we got from our project manager.
Goals for the following week: 
Finalize the UI of the Dashboard with Chris
Work on the ER diagrams and Schema
Start to create the front End for our application


Andy
Goals from last week: 
Teaming with Frank to work on Discussion Board and Calendar Schedule
Next week mainly getting started with the Discussion Board. Creating the front end of it using HTML and CSS.
I was not able to get started with the Discussion board this week. The feedback we took made me spend more time revising our development plan. Based on the feedback me and Frank have decided to narrow down the Calendar Schedule as our main goal compared to the Discussion Board since it is a more unique feature to our app. I updated the living document in respect to that, and also revised the risks that we might encounter to be more specific to the LivingBuddy project.
Goals:
Teaming with Frank to work on Calendar Schedule
Next week: researching available libraries to implement Calendar Schedule. Creating basic html/css framework for the page.

Chris
Goals from last week: 
Unfortunately, I was not able to make time with Yazan to brainstorm about the design and architecture of the Dashboard component. This however should not be too big of an issue considering that we will be spending this week 
I worked on revising the requirement document which lacked some information, which was a task that was not anticipated last week. However, this task helped me solidify my idea of what the different features might look like, and raised questions that would have eventually been raised. For example, I realised that the chat feature is going to appear as one of the following: entire window or a pop up, which naturally prompted me to think which is a better option? Also, I asked myself which was a more feasible option, where I concluded that a chat screen that takes up the entire window was easier to implement than a pop up, and decided that it will be the priority during our earlier phase. 
Goals:
Contribute to finalizing the architecture and design of the app, which might have to start with a high level brainstorming session that was supposed to happen last week.
Find a suitable UI template for the dashboard
If the architecture and design was finalized earlier than expected, I could go on to start implementing the dashboard component
