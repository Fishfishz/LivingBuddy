Chris
- Goals from last week: 
  - Contribute to finalizing the architecture and design of the app, which might have to start with a high level brainstorming session that was supposed to happen last week.
  - Find a suitable UI template for the dashboard
  - If the architecture and design was finalized earlier than expected, I could go on to start implementing the dashboard component

- What I have done this week:
  - I have made significant contributions to the architecture and the design of the app, especially in identifying the components and designing the schema of the database. However, I also received support from my teammates. For example, when I was stuck on thinking of how to distinguish each resident, Frank, who is more experienced with using Firebase suggested using the ID that is autogenerated by Firebase. 
  - Finding the UI template was not difficult as I have seen Material UI being used in other React projects I have worked on before.
  - Again, unfortunately I was not able to start implementing the dashboard component, as I spent time contributing to the design and architecture.
- Goals:
  - Contribute to the testing plan.
  - Start implementing the Dashboard component. Since we have about 2 weeks until the planned deadline for completing this component, this should go on in parallel with writing out the testing plan.
