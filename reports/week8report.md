Andy
- Goals from last week: 
   - Continue implementing Calendar Schedule
   - Create landing page for Calendar Schedule

- What I have done:
   - Created Andy branch to work on Calendar Schedule. Created a simple landing page for Calendar Schedule using react switch. There are two buttons, one for rooms and one for equipment. Users can click on either one to open up the table that shows all the available rooms/equipment in the dorm. (Originally I was able to make the table open in a new page, but the rooms and equipments tab showed up on the side bar, so I had to scratch that).
   - Created pull request for the new update on Calendar Schedule. 

- Goals:
   - Make buttons bigger for the landing page, and make it squares that divide the page.
   - Make the rooms and equipments table show up in a new tab.

Chris
 - Goals from last week:
   - Start working on implementing the chat thread, whose prototype we plan to complete by 5/25.
   - Contribute to the documentation

 - What I have worked on this week:
   - Though we have not started implementing the chat thread, me and Yazan will schedule a time this week to work on it.
   - I have contributed to the user documentation by filling in the section associated with bugs. For example, I have talked about specific bugs that have come up while implementing our prototype: both resolved and unresolved. Also, I have specified a format in which the user can report bugs that arise while using our app.

 - Goals:
   - Work with Yazan to complete at least the prototype of chat thread. This is not a hard deadline, as we still have time until final release, but it is best to have a buffer in our schedule.
   - Contribute to the peer review assignment.
