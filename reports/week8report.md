 - Goals from last week:
   - Start working on implementing the chat thread, whose prototype we plan to complete by 5/25.
   - Contribute to the documentation

 - What I have worked on this week
   - Though we have not started implementing the chat thread, me and Yazan will schedule a time this week to work on it.
   - I have contributed to the user documentation by filling in the section associated with bugs. For example, I have talked about specific bugs that have come up while implementing our prototype: both resolved and unresolved. Also, I have specified a format in which the user can report bugs that arise while using our app.

 - Goals:
   - Work with Yazan to complete at least the prototype of chat thread. This is not a hard deadline, as we still have time until final release, but it is best to have a buffer in our schedule.
   - Contribute to the peer review assignment.
