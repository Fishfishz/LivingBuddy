Team Report: 

- Empty for this week
- Our team got together to work on the requirements for the Living Buddy WebApp. What worked for us was brainstorming on our personal experiences in Dorms and then we reflected on that. Based on our experiences, we came up with some problems that needed to be solved and would make the lives of students easier. We mostly struggled with coming up with stretch goals for our app but we figured it out.
- Next week, we will be experimenting with the frameworks we have chosen to get a feel of what architecture and design will be suitable for this project. It is in our best interest not to start implementing the functionalities too soon, as it is important that we have a blueprint that will satisfy the requirements we have written last week

Individual Report:

Frank
Goals from a week ago: 
- Empty for this week
- what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck:
I worked on the Requirements and Team Policy document with other teammates, brainstormed use cases for students using the discussion board. I also discussed the software tool we are going to use for our project, specifically comparing the tradeoff between mysql services on aws and google firestore and firebase. 
- Goals for the following week: 
Set up the Github and Google firebase project
Set up a React project and push to Github
Work on the database architecture design
Finalize the details for the discussion board functionality and start to implement it with Andy

Yazan
- Empty for this week
- I brainstormed ways to verify students when they make an account on our webapp to be added to the specific dorms, I understood that there is always  some         sensitive information that needs to stay inside the dorms itself, Therefore I came up with an idea to verify students identities by manually contacting the RA’s  of the dorms and confirming with them that the students lives in the dorm before giving any access to them.
- Next week, I will be teaming up with Chris to work on the Design for the Dashboard of our app and also finalize the features like ChatBox requirements.

Andy
- Empty for this week
- I worked on parts of the Requirements and Team Policy doc, adding a use case for people using the washing/drying machine. I also thought about the risks our project might run into, such as running into bugs in our core features that makes our whole site unavailable. Working on the use cases helped me to visualize our website’s features, especially the Calendar Schedule part, better. I was a bit stuck thinking whether our site needs login or not. If we do then there might be security issues, but if we do not that will also mean leaking dorm information. In the end I think we have to have a login.
- Goals:
Teaming with Frank to work on Discussion Board and Calendar Schedule
Next week mainly getting started with the Discussion Board. Creating the front end of it using HTML and CSS.

Chris
- Empty for this week
- I made progress by thinking of the multiple scenarios in which the application can be used, which exposed some issues with the idea that we had not previously thought of. This includes scalability(how many dorms should our app be applicable for?) security(how should the app recognise authorized residents?). Another scenario was when we should be censoring texts in the chat thread. I proposed that swear/offensive words should be blocked in the chat thread.
- I will be working with Yazan to brainstorm about the design and architecture of the Dashboard component. We might even start using the frameworks to implement the core structure of the component based on our proposed architecture, but not beyond that to avoid having to revert all of our progress in case we as a group change our minds.
