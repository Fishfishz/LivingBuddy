Team Report: 
- Goals from last week:
  - We would like to complete a prototype for dashboard and calendar schedule
  - We will prepare the presentation for the beta release
- What we have done:
  - We have completed a prototype for dashboard, calendar schedule, as well as the sign in screen and the campus map. We had some difficulties trying to merge these features together, but we have resolved it through meetings and active communication on Slack.
  - We have delivered the presentation for the beta release, where we communicated our reflection on the projectâ€™s current progress as well as our plans for the coming weeks.

 - Goals from last week:
   - Implement the prototype for the dashboard
   - Prepare for the beta release presentation 
 - What I have done:
   - I have collaborated with Yazan to successfully implement the prototype for the dashboard. While it could potentially have more features, we focused on the single use case, which was for the RA to be able to post events. We have worked on this through pair programming, where we verbally gave each other ideas of how to write the code to communicate with the database, as well as rendering the events that were stored in the database. When we faced issues such as compilation errors, we looked for relevant articles according to the error message until the webapp successfully compiled.
   - I have contributed to the presentation by talking about the features of the dashboard we have implemented, and what our(me and Yazan) goal is for the upcoming weeks, which is to implement the chat thread.
 - Goals:
   - Start working on implementing the chat thread, whose prototype we plan to complete by 5/25.
   - Contribute to the documentation
