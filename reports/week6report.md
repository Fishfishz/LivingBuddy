Team Report: 
- Goals from last week: 
  - Complete the testing plan
  - Start implementing the dashboard and the calendar schedule
- What I have done this week:  
  - We have produced a more sophisticated testing plan by considering the pros and cons of the different CI services that exist in the market.
  - We have deployed the CI environment and we can start adding tests regarding the rendered components anytime.
- Goals:
  - We would like to complete a prototype for dashboard and calendar schedule
  - We will prepare the presentation for the beta release

Individual Report:

Frank
- Goals from a week ago: 
  - Work on the login page.
  - Finish the layout design for Calendar Scheduler
  - Finish the CICD for the project
- what you did:
I mainly worked on implementing the CI and test framework for the project. I have learned how to write tests using the Jest React Testing framework. I had trouble setting up the Travis CI for the project. The build was failed because it treated the warning as failure. It took me some time to research for that and I figured it out. I also completed the how to write test part of the document.

- Goals for the following week: 
  - Finish the basic html and components design and implementation for the calendar scheduler with Andy
  - Add a test suite along with the implementation.

Yazan
- Goals from a week ago:
  - Integrate the UI template with our webapp
  - Start to work on the design for the Dashboard of our app. 
  
- What you did:
  - I worked on the integration of the UI template that we will be using for our Web app, It took me a while to figure it out as the npm install was failing. I had to research on how to make the install work.

- Goals for the following week:
  - I will be working with Chris to finalize the dashboard UI and start the coding part for it.
  - I will also be working on our next assignment.

Andy
- Goals from last week: 
  - Teaming with Frank to work on Calendar Schedule
  - Next week: create the landing page for Calendar Schedule.
- I updated the living doc with pros and cons of different CI services. We ended up deciding on Travis CI because it is a great tool for not-so-large projects like ours. I have the designs of the landing page of Calendar Schedule ready, and Frank and I set up a meet on the weekend to cook it up. I learned that we can deploy our website on google firebase instead of hosting it on our local computer like what I thought before.
- Goals:
  - Basic html design for Calendar Schedule with Frank
  - Meet during weekend
  - Next week: create the landing page for Calendar Schedule.


Chris
- Goals from last week:
  - Contribute to the testing plan.
  - Start implementing the Dashboard component. Since we have about 2 weeks until the planned deadline for completing this component, this should go on in parallel with writing out the testing plan.
- What I have done:
  - I contributed to the test plan by researching what testing framework might suit our project. While I found that Mocha.js was a commonly used framework for Javascript, we as a team found out that Jest is compatible with other frameworks that we are using, such as React.js.
  - I have downloaded the template repo from Material UI and am still working on integrating it with our project. As far as the implementation goes, I again did not make a lot of progress. One of the reason was that in our weekly meeting, Anny(our project manager) emphasised that the importance of the project is in the documentation and not necessarily on the implementation of the actual application, which led me to think that our priority should be to address the feedbacks that were given for our living document. Other than that, I have also had to cut commitments due to having a fever for a couple of days after receiving my COVID vaccine along with a strictly timed midterm in another class.
- Goals:
  - Implement the prototype for the dashboard
  - Prepare for the beta release presentation
